# Advent of Code 2022 solutions

These are my solutions for this year's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

All solutions are ruby oneliners (a solution that consists of only one line of code). All scripts can be invoked with just `ruby <script>`. If you want to see all solutions so far, execute `ruby solutions.rb`, where solutions.rb is of course itself a oneliner ;).

If you do not trust me, you can check with `wc -l $(find . -type f -name "solution*.rb")`.

If you have suggestions, feedback or anything else, feel free to open an issue.
